## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The most challenging part of this submission was attempting to complete it outside of work and school assignments. Time management was a very important factor in completing this.]
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Is web development just working on websites? Is there anything else that defines a developer other than working on websites?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would have wanted to included a timer and change the speed of clues with every round, randomize the clues every game. I would have also randomized the position of the buttons with each new game. This would make the buttons and tones more difficult to remember.]
